Its all about api

Today I created 4 small applications to learn anout Api's

# 1  Simple fetching apis 
This application fetches the Api from: https://api.sunrise-sunset.org/json?lat={lat}&lng={lng} and view you the timings of Sunrise And Sunset in your latitude and longitude. I f you dont give any input, the default output will show you the sunrise and sunset time of New Delhi

#2 Joke Application with tkinter 
This application is made up with python tkinter module. In this application , we are calling https://api.kanye.rest/ API and displaying jokes/quotes in the Tkinter window. There is a regenerate button, which regenerates the jokes/quotes and display it on the window.

#3  ISS Application
This appliction goes to some complexity, here we fetch the api ( http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json ), and we get the latitude and longitude location of the ISS (internations Space Station. A simple mail will be sent to you, whne the iss will reach the desired latitude and longitude. If you dont give any input, the desired location will be New Delhi.
